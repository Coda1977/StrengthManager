## 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **CSS Structure Matters**
   - Keep styles outside `@layer` blocks
   - Watch for unclosed media queries
   - Test at multiple screen sizes

2. **RLS Policies Are Tricky**
   - Avoid querying same table in policies
   - Test policies thoroughly
   - Use specific field selects

3. **User Approval Required**
   - Don't mark features complete without testing
   - Get explicit approval before moving on
   - Test end-to-end flows

4. **Incremental Development Works**
   - Phased approach prevents bugs
   - Easier to debug small pieces
   - Better code quality

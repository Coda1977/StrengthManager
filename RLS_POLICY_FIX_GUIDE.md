# RLS Policy Fix Guide

## üìã Executive Summary

This guide documents a comprehensive fix for Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues in the Strength Manager application. The migration addresses three critical problems that were preventing proper database access control:

### What Was Wrong

1. **Infinite Recursion**: The [`is_admin()`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql:150) function was querying `public.users` while evaluating policies ON `public.users`, creating an infinite loop
2. **Missing DELETE Policies**: None of the 11 database tables had DELETE policies, preventing admins from removing records
3. **Incomplete CRUD Coverage**: Several tables lacked complete Create, Read, Update, Delete policy sets

### What The Fix Does

The migration ([`20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql)) implements a comprehensive solution:

- ‚úÖ Eliminates infinite recursion by reading admin status from `auth.users` metadata
- ‚úÖ Adds complete CRUD policies (44 total) across all 11 tables
- ‚úÖ Implements automatic role synchronization between `public.users` and `auth.users`
- ‚úÖ Provides a clean slate by dropping and recreating all policies

### Impact on Application

- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can now delete users and perform all management operations
- **User Access**: Regular users maintain proper data isolation
- **System Stability**: No more infinite recursion errors
- **Data Integrity**: CASCADE deletions work correctly across related tables

## üîç Problem Analysis

### Timeline of RLS Policy Issues

The application experienced a cascade of RLS policy problems across 7 migrations:

1. **[`20241009000000_initial_schema.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241009000000_initial_schema.sql)** - Initial schema with basic RLS policies
2. **[`20241009000001_fix_rls_policies.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241009000001_fix_rls_policies.sql)** - First attempt to fix policy issues
3. **[`20241009000002_fix_infinite_recursion.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241009000002_fix_infinite_recursion.sql)** - Attempted to fix recursion (incomplete)
4. **[`20241009000003_remove_admin_recursion.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241009000003_remove_admin_recursion.sql)** - Another recursion fix attempt
5. **[`20241015000000_optimize_rls_policies.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241015000000_optimize_rls_policies.sql)** - Performance optimization attempt
6. **[`20241016000000_restore_admin_policies.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241016000000_restore_admin_policies.sql)** - Restored admin access
7. **[`20241016000001_fix_recursive_admin_policy.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241016000001_fix_recursive_admin_policy.sql)** - Final recursion fix attempt

### Root Cause: Recursive `is_admin()` Function

The core issue was in the [`is_admin()`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql:150) function implementation:

```sql
-- ‚ùå PROBLEMATIC: Creates infinite recursion
CREATE FUNCTION is_admin() RETURNS boolean AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    SELECT role = 'admin' 
    FROM public.users  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Queries the same table being protected!
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
  );
END;
$$;
```

**Why This Failed:**
1. User tries to query `public.users` table
2. RLS policy calls `is_admin()` to check permissions
3. `is_admin()` queries `public.users` to check role
4. This triggers RLS policy again ‚Üí infinite loop
5. Database returns error or timeout

### Missing DELETE Policies

Architectural analysis revealed that **zero** DELETE policies existed across all tables:

| Table | SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| users | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| team_members | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| chat_conversations | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| chat_messages | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| email_preferences | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| email_subscriptions | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| email_logs | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| unsubscribe_tokens | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| ai_usage_logs | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| analytics_events | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| strengths | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

This prevented admins from performing essential management tasks like removing users or cleaning up old data.

### Incomplete CRUD Coverage

Several tables had gaps in their policy coverage:
- **chat_messages**: Missing UPDATE and DELETE
- **email_preferences**: Missing INSERT
- **email_logs**: Missing UPDATE and DELETE
- **ai_usage_logs**: Missing UPDATE and DELETE
- **analytics_events**: Missing UPDATE and DELETE

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### Non-Recursive `is_admin()` Function

The fix implements a new [`is_admin()`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql:150) function that reads from `auth.users` metadata:

```sql
-- ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Reads from auth.users metadata (no recursion)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin()
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
STABLE
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Check role from auth.users metadata instead of querying public.users
  RETURN COALESCE(
    (
      SELECT (raw_user_meta_data->>'role')::text = 'admin'
      FROM auth.users  -- ‚úÖ Different table - no recursion!
      WHERE id = auth.uid()
    ),
    false
  );
END;
$$;
```

**Why This Works:**
1. `auth.users` is in a different schema (not protected by RLS policies)
2. No circular dependency between policy evaluation and function execution
3. Metadata is always accessible without triggering additional policy checks
4. `SECURITY DEFINER` ensures function has necessary permissions

### Complete CRUD Policies

The migration creates **44 policies** across **11 tables**, ensuring complete CRUD coverage:

```sql
-- Example: Complete policy set for users table
CREATE POLICY "users_select" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id OR is_admin());

CREATE POLICY "users_insert" ON public.users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "users_update" ON public.users
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id OR is_admin());

CREATE POLICY "users_delete" ON public.users
  FOR DELETE USING (is_admin());  -- ‚úÖ NEW: Admins can delete
```

### Role Synchronization Mechanism

To keep `public.users` and `auth.users` in sync, the migration implements an automatic trigger:

```sql
-- Function to sync role changes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.sync_role_to_auth()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE auth.users
  SET raw_user_meta_data = COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb) 
    || jsonb_build_object('role', NEW.role)
  WHERE id = NEW.id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

-- Trigger fires on role changes
CREATE TRIGGER sync_role_to_auth_trigger
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF role ON public.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.sync_role_to_auth();
```

**How It Works:**
1. When a user's role changes in `public.users`
2. Trigger automatically updates `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
3. [`is_admin()`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql:150) function always reads current role
4. No manual synchronization needed

## üì¶ Migration Details

### What The Migration Does

The migration ([`20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql)) is organized into 5 parts:

#### Part 1: One-Time Data Sync
```sql
-- Sync existing role data from public.users to auth.users metadata
UPDATE auth.users au
SET raw_user_meta_data = COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb) 
  || jsonb_build_object('role', u.role)
FROM public.users u
WHERE au.id = u.id;
```

#### Part 2: Drop All Existing Policies
- Removes all 30+ existing policies
- Clean slate approach prevents conflicts
- Ensures consistent policy naming

#### Part 3: Create Non-Recursive `is_admin()` Function
- Drops old recursive function
- Creates new function reading from `auth.users`
- Grants execute permission to authenticated users

#### Part 4: Create Role Sync Trigger
- Implements automatic role synchronization
- Keeps `public.users` and `auth.users` in sync
- Fires on INSERT or UPDATE of role column

#### Part 5: Create Complete Policy Set
- Creates 44 policies across 11 tables
- Ensures complete CRUD coverage
- Implements proper access control for each table

### Tables Affected

All 11 database tables receive updated policies:

1. **users** - User profiles and authentication
2. **team_members** - Team member relationships
3. **chat_conversations** - AI coach conversation threads
4. **chat_messages** - Individual messages in conversations
5. **email_preferences** - User email notification settings
6. **email_subscriptions** - Email subscription status
7. **email_logs** - Email delivery tracking
8. **unsubscribe_tokens** - Email unsubscribe tokens
9. **ai_usage_logs** - AI API usage tracking
10. **analytics_events** - Application analytics
11. **strengths** - CliftonStrengths reference data

### Policies Created

**Total: 44 policies** (4 per table √ó 11 tables)

Each table receives:
- ‚úÖ **SELECT** policy - Who can read data
- ‚úÖ **INSERT** policy - Who can create records
- ‚úÖ **UPDATE** policy - Who can modify records
- ‚úÖ **DELETE** policy - Who can remove records (NEW!)

### Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This migration includes breaking changes:

1. **All existing RLS policies are dropped and recreated**
   - Policy names may change
   - Any code referencing specific policy names needs updating

2. **`is_admin()` function behavior changes**
   - Now reads from `auth.users` metadata instead of `public.users`
   - Existing admin users need role synced to metadata (handled automatically)

3. **Role changes now trigger metadata updates**
   - New trigger fires on role modifications
   - May impact performance if roles change frequently (unlikely)

4. **DELETE operations now require admin role**
   - Regular users cannot delete their own data
   - Admins have full delete permissions

---

# Have backup admin account ready
```

#### 4. Schedule Maintenance Window

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Recommended**: Deploy during low-traffic period
- Notify users of brief maintenance window
- Have rollback plan ready
- Monitor system during deployment

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Link to Production

```bash
# Link to production project
supabase link --project-ref your-production-project-ref

# Verify you're linked to correct project
supabase status
```

#### Step 2: Review Migration

```bash
# Review what will be applied
supabase db diff

# Expected output: Shows the comprehensive RLS fix migration
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Migration

```bash
# Deploy to production
supabase db push --linked

# Monitor output for errors

```

#### Step 4: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check migration was applied
supabase db remote commit list

# Should show: 20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

Complete these checks immediately after deployment:

#### 1. Monitor for Errors

```bash
# Check Supabase logs for errors
# In Supabase Dashboard: Logs > Database

# Look for:
# - "infinite recursion" errors (should be GONE)
# - "permission denied" errors (should be minimal)
# - Unusual query patterns
```

#### 2. Verify Admin Dashboard

- [ ] Log in as admin user
- [ ] Navigate to admin dashboard
- [ ] Verify user list loads
- [ ] Test deleting a test user
- [ ] Check all admin features work

#### 3. Test User Deletion

```sql
-- Create and delete a test user
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, full_name, role)
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'post-deploy-test@example.com',
  'Post Deploy Test',
  'user'
);

DELETE FROM public.users WHERE email = 'post-deploy-test@example.com';

-- Expected: Deletion succeeds, related data cascades
```

#### 4. Check Application Logs

- Monitor application logs for 15-30 minutes
- Look for database-related errors
- Verify normal user operations work
- Check API endpoints respond correctly

#### 5. Verify Role Sync

```sql
-- Verify role sync trigger is working
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as users_with_synced_roles
FROM auth.users
WHERE raw_user_meta_data->>'role' IS NOT NULL;

-- Expected: Should match total user count
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment, follow this rollback procedure:

### Emergency Rollback

#### Option 1: Restore from Backup (Recommended)

```bash
# Restore from pre-deployment backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup_before_rls_fix_YYYYMMDD.sql

# Verify restoration
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.users;"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will lose any data created after backup was taken.

#### Option 2: Revert Migration

```bash
# Create a revert migration
supabase migration new revert_comprehensive_rls_fix

# Manually add SQL to restore previous policies
# This is complex and error-prone - use backup restore instead
```

### Emergency Access Procedures

If admin access is lost:

#### 1. Direct Database Access

```bash
# Connect directly to database
psql $DATABASE_URL

-- Manually set admin role
UPDATE auth.users 
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

#### 2. Disable RLS Temporarily

```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è EMERGENCY ONLY - Disables all security
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Re-enable after fixing issue
ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Permission denied for table users"

**Symptoms:**
- Admin cannot view users
- Error: "permission denied for table users"

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify admin role is set in metadata
SELECT raw_user_meta_data->>'role' 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- If null or incorrect, update it
UPDATE auth.users 
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'your-admin@example.com';
```

#### Issue: "Infinite recursion detected"

**Symptoms:**
- Queries timeout
- Error mentions "infinite recursion"
- Database becomes unresponsive

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify is_admin() function is using auth.users
SELECT prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'is_admin';

-- Should contain "FROM auth.users" not "FROM public.users"

-- If incorrect, reapply migration
-- Or manually recreate function from migration file
```

#### Issue: Role not syncing

**Symptoms:**
- Role changes in `public.users` don't reflect in admin status
- [`is_admin()`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql:150) returns wrong value

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT tgname 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'sync_role_to_auth_trigger';

-- If missing, recreate trigger
CREATE TRIGGER sync_role_to_auth_trigger
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF role ON public.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.sync_role_to_auth();

-- Manually sync existing data
UPDATE auth.users au
SET raw_user_meta_data = COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb) 
  || jsonb_build_object('role', u.role)
FROM public.users u
WHERE au.id = u.id;
```

#### Issue: Policies not applying

**Symptoms:**
- Users can see data they shouldn't
- Admin cannot perform operations
- Inconsistent access control

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- All should show 't' (true)

-- Check policy count
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename;

-- Each table should have 4 policies

-- If policies are missing, reapply migration
```

#### Issue: CASCADE deletions not working

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot delete users with related data
- Foreign key constraint errors

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify foreign key constraints have ON DELETE CASCADE
SELECT
  tc.table_name,
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
  rc.delete_rule
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints AS rc
  ON rc.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_schema = 'public';

-- delete_rule should be 'CASCADE' for user_id foreign keys
```

#### Issue: Performance degradation

**Symptoms:**
- Queries are slower after migration
- Admin dashboard loads slowly

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if indexes exist
SELECT tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Verify user_id columns are indexed
-- Add missing indexes if needed
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_team_members_user_id 
  ON team_members(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_chat_conversations_user_id 
  ON chat_conversations(user_id);

-- Analyze tables for query planner
ANALYZE;
```

### Key Concepts

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
PostgreSQL feature that restricts which rows users can access based on policies. Essential for multi-tenant applications.

#### Security Definer
Function attribute that executes with the privileges of the function owner, not the caller. Required for [`is_admin()`](strength-manager/supabase/migrations/20241017000000_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql:150) to access `auth.users`.

#### JSONB Metadata
Supabase stores custom user data in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data` as JSONB. This allows flexible user attributes without schema changes.

#### Trigger Functions
PostgreSQL functions that automatically execute in response to table events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Used for role synchronization.

### Database Schema

```
auth.users (Supabase managed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id (uuid, primary key)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email (text)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw_user_meta_data (jsonb) ‚Üê Contains role
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

public.users (Application managed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id (uuid, primary key, references auth.users)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email (text)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ role (text) ‚Üê Synced to auth.users metadata
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

Relationship: 1:1 between auth.users and public.users
Sync: Automatic via trigger on public.users
```
